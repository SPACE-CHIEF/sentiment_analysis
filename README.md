# Using Sentiment Analysis of News Headlines to Predict the Stock Market

Hi, I tested

For the article with explanation, it's [here](https://ostiguyphilippe.medium.com/using-sentiment-analysis-to-predict-the-stock-market-77100295d753).

Full documentation also available in each file in this repo. This is the [main.py](https://github.com/philippe-ostiguy/sentiment_analysis/blob/master/main.py).

I hope this code will help for sentiment analysis of news headlines or for any other trading strategy.

Cheers!
